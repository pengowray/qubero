Starting out: 15/08/2002
 Mooj creates a SimpleFileChunk, and a wrapping OpenFileNode (was DefNode)
 Mooj triggers HexView() on OpenFileNode
 OpenFileNode.HexView() loads HexEditorGUI (xxx: in future, may latch on to existing HexEditorGUI for MDI)
 All operations go via OpenFileNode (e.g. selection, definiton, etc)
 Updates about OpenFileNode are learnt about via subscription.
 xxx: in future an OpenFileNode may have mutliple SplitView's each SplitView can have its own selections / menu.. but this gets messy.
