pointers to pointers to pointers opens up a whole user interface nightmare

 - v0.1 stick to setting the value for only the top pointer.
 - edit lower pointers through "edit referenced value..." (opens new dialog)
 - ownership!
 - finding a suitable "primative" type!
  
 - getValue() should give the final (lowest) value
 - setValue() sets the highest
  
names:
 - e.g. "type" selection for integer "first record size"
 - e.g. variable "i" in for-loop scope of getSelection() in net.pengo.IntAddressedResource
 - a tree view
 - overlay view on hex data
