 - inbuilt support for integers (any size). Unsigned, signed and other formats (currently sizes must be a mutliple of 8 bits)
 - multiple undo
 - scalible. Can chop and change very large files (> 2gig) with a small memory footprint.
 - native diff file support: save "changes only" to a diff file, or keep backup as a diff.

Still in progress:
 - text mode (currently only swing)
 - not yet optimized for small files.
