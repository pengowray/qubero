Bedrock is:
 - a binary-data modeller
 - based around the user interface of a hexidecimal editor.

Definition interface is powerful because it does:
 - give meaning to raw data
 - allow definitions of addresses and regions
 - support a wide range of data types found in any data
 - support limitless custom data types
 - support custom data polymorphism
 - include defining functions to.... blah

Source code is not yet available and is currently pure Java. User interface is (currently) Swing.

Features (complete or mostly complete):
 - layered data sources. Keep data sources and views on separate layers. e.g. Easy movement and editing of changes
 - plug-in new views for templated data
 - inbuilt support for integers (any size). Unsigned, signed and other formats (currently sizes must be a mutliple of 8 bits)
 - multiple undo
 - scalible. Can chop and change very large files (> 2gig) with a small memory footprint.
 - native diff file support: save "changes only" to a diff file, or keep backup as a diff.

Still in progress:
 - text mode (currently only swing)
 - not yet optimized for small files.
