 ...
 2002-10-14  "Splash" screen (for FontMentricsCaching)
             LineRepeater complete (but faulty)
 2002-10-30  HexTable now displays with units aligned nicely (kinda)
 2002-11-09  HexTable selection now selects in the right shape
 2002-11-10  created DefaultLongListSelectionModel / LongListSelectionModel / LongListSelectionEvent / LongListSelectionListener
             selection now triggers events (as before)
 2002-11-18  SelectionData created. various other fixes.
 2002-11-19  Compiles/Runs again. lots of xxx's to fix.
 2002-11-25  SegmentalLongListSelectionModel finally complete (little debugging needed still)
 2002-11-26  above debugged. can really do multiple selections now
 ...
 2003-05-10  back to coding. started debugging, refactoring
 2003-07-02  renamed many methods in Data. ColumnGroup no longer for JTables
 2003-07-03  everything put in packages
             original.HexPanel working with new selection scheme
             restree works somewhat
             fixed data's readByteArray(long, int)

 2003-07-04  hexpanel accepts new selections now (can double click on resources in restree to hilite again)
 2003-07-05  fixed old bug: can no longer select past end of hex

priority/immediate features todo:
 2003-07-09
 - make hexpanel's repaint more accurate
 - force notify for selections (for when they are first used). this means simple selection needs to able to to notify.
 2003-07-05
 - make a resource model ala selection model
 - iterator for all selected addresses in any selection model
 - make hexpanel use selection model for active selection too
 - show multi selection's segments in tree
 2003-07-02:
 - finish ColumnGroup and the column groups
 - SelectionData needs to be part of Data (instead of New Sel Data)
 - SelectionData is not multithread happy: fails to clone data. solution requires data update notification in case of non-static data.
 - make an ant make process
 older:
 - get rid of bit array usage from UnifiedSelection thing
 - rectangular selections
 - get old stuff working again
 - EDIT hex / ascii
 - put HexTables together to make them long too (combined with UnifiedSelectionModel)
 - MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION editing modes:
    fixed length
    overflow mode (+ overflow / length indicators / combined overflow indicator / string terminator / secondary overflow+)
    block pattern
 - background "color"/pattern: revealed when holes are made or new stuff added
 - new long demo: blocks of 8 bytes of the first byte's address.
 - save
 - undo
 - layers
 - ascii as unicode
 - duplicate hex (copy/paste)
 - error messages / throw exceptions
 - screen updates when needed (after updates)
 - calculate int min + max
 - proper definitions
 - major refactoring (layers, editing policy)
 - save/open template definitions
 - make all menus work
 - documentation + read me
 - status messages
 - multiple documents open (mdi-ish)
 - clean up xxx's
 - clean up demo file code
 - "show System.out" in a window (menu option)
 - rename "get" methods that don't really "get"(?)
 - selection data is not verified.
 - export/import to/from c
 - configuration for columns and column groups: min/max/pref width, font resizing (min/max/pref), exported pref values (e.g. width of two chars), values based on screen width, fonts/sizes from windows/browser/gnome/java/other-hex-ap defaults
 - set columns you want in brief (eg "addr: XX XX XX XX aaaa"), then detailed configuration for each column group below.
 - multi-heading columns (and rows later):
 - eg. | addr |    hex    | asci |
       | addr:|XX|XX|XX|XX| aaaa |
   resize individual columns or column groups
  
UI to do:
 - only double click should select in tree
 - allow right click on hex area
 - show selection on ascii side as a hollow box
 - highlighting colour scheme
 D*when right clicking a (non-selected) item on tree, show a dotted outline selection
 - DnD tree elements
 - select a template area by clicking it on the hex side
 - header lines (eg "1 Megabyte", "10 Megabytes", or "1st Megabyte"?)

bugs:
 - column widths calculations
 - making an integer smaller shouldn't (automatically) reduce its byte count
 - changing the size of an integer SHOULD change its DEFINED size too (and not just grow/shrink the board)
 - require warnings and options for both of the above. (including an option to only have, say, 4 and 8 byte ints and not 5)
 - Save as does not ask "Are you sure?" for overwrite
 - non-file does not throw exception [FileChunk]
 - Break resources don't "delete" properly.. sends wrong Category type.
 - fix bug: rename of item destroys it
 - "negative zero" for one's comp and sign magnitude
 - overlap of lines on very big files:
   Bug ID: 4707774 Graphics.drawString( String, int, int ) not precise for large ints
   http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4707774.html (fixed)
