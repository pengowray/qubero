My Review of Binary.Browser.v4.2
2005-01-27

ugh. binary browser is a pretty clunky hex editor, and it's really unintuative. 

I right clicked on some hex and picked "flip".. I wasn't sure if it would flip the byte order or the bit order.. Instead, it flipped around the display of panels on the screen. 

When looking at a BMP (for example) in the strut view you it won't find the location of a defined structure in the main hex view pane for you. Ugh.

There's no editing of bits (it does call itself "binary" browser). The views aren't configurable. I could go on. I can't believe this is a v4 release and not an early beta.

If you want a real Hex Editor wait for Qubero.
