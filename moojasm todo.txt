"templatation"
view, edit, create java bytecode + automation

"""get it working first
get it right later
"""

Log started Aug 21 2002:
 2002-08-21: Added types (int only for now)
             Added grey mode
             Corrected ascent bug.. characters were at wrong Y position

priority features:
 - definitions
 - save/open template definitions
 - EDIT hex / ascii
 - make all menus work
 - documentation
 - status messages
 - partial/background loading: only load what's displayed (large files especially)
 - multiple documents open (mdi-ish)

UI:
 - allow right click on hex area
 - wheel jumps too slow
 - arrow key movement
 - show selection on ascii side as a hollow box
 - bigger west pane for tree
 - new selection: auto open up tree
 - highlighting colour scheme
 D*when right clicking a (non-selected) item on tree, show a dotted outline selection 
 - DnD tree elements
 - select a template area by clicking it on the hex side

bugs:
 - bug: end bit of first file opened is dodgy until resize or open of new file (this is due to incorrect guess of font size)
 - fix bug: rename of item destroys it

read this:
 - http://tunes.org/files/papers/Arrow_Introduction_v8.htm

for v0.2
 - sequential + recursive + random access + dependant + compression definitions of parts of file (xml defintion)
 - scoped type definition with inheritance
 - external main definition file
D hex display 
 - highlighting of parts (outline) and errors (red)
D display: tree of parts

 - array/table numbering systems
 - search / jump
 - text only display

for v0.3

   class file types: u1, u2, u4, 
   infos: cp_info, field_info, method_info, attribute_info
   arrays: count then array
